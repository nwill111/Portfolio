                  Building Recognition of university buildings using a
                  pre-trained ResNet50 archetecture
                </h2>
                <p>
                  The purpose of this project is to create a model that can
                  identify the building shown in an image taken by a user on the
                  UNCC campus. The reason behind this is that there's currently
                  no dataset available that has images of all the buildings on
                  the UNCC campus. This project is not only fun, but it's also
                  useful as the model, if accurate, could be used on other
                  campuses or in large cities where multiple buildings need to
                  be recognized. The project is limited to the UNCC campus, but
                  the possibilities for its use in the future are endless.
                  Imagine being able to use it for self-guided tours or even
                  navigation. The best part? We get to create the dataset
                  ourselves, making the project even more meaningful to the UNCC
                  community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For this project, we used a pretrained ResNet50 archetecture
                  as we determined from our research that this model would
                  provide us with the best results for our use case. Despite
                  what was found in our research, we still tested an examined
                  the results of using other model types, such as using a CNN
                  from scratch, or using different pretrained models. It was
                  found that using ResNet50 would be the best for us. The
                  hyperparameters used included a learning rate of 0.0001, 15
                  epochs, an image size of (224 x 224), a horizontal flip data
                  augmentation technique, and data normalization that was
                  zero-centered. The loss function used was cross-entropy. The
                  Adam optimizer was chosen as it is computationally efficient
                  and better suited for non-linear applications than the
                  alternative, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The resulting model provided us with an accuracy of around
                  85&#37;
